I'll try update the gui, instead of using imgui use command line args. I'll update when i feel like it :)

Golang nuker made by xanthe/azael1337

This can be used as templates for people who wanna skid it, it has the bans cmds etc.. If you dont know how to run golang I'll update this later when I feel like it at and tell you how.

To run this make sure you have all downloaded requirements and open up command terminal through the folder and type in "go run main.go"

I'll prolly make a video on how to run it cause most people are sped. Thank you.
